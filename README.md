# Description

**eLabFTW** is an electronic lab notebook manager for research teams.

It lets you store and organize your research experiments easily. It also features a database where any kind of objects (such as antibodies, plasmids, cell lines, boxes, _etc_.) can be stored.
It is accessed _via_ the browser. Several research teams can be hosted on the same installation. This means **eLabFTW** can be installed at the institute level and host all team members at the same place. This is what is done at [Institut Curie](http://www.curie.fr) and in several other research centers around the globe.

**eLabFTW** is designed to be installed on a server, and people from the team can log in from their browser.

Without a server, even an old computer with 1 GB of RAM and an old CPU can be used. Make sure to install a recent GNU/Linux distribution on it and plug it to the intranet.

# Installation

**eLabFTW** can easily be installed on any GNU/Linux server. It requires at least 512 MB of RAM (1 GB recommended) and 300 MB of disk space. Installation is done through Docker, so [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) needs to be installed on your computer. Since it runs in a Docker container, php, webservers or mysql do not have to be installed on your server.  Everything is provided by the container so different versions and extensions do not matter.

The documentation explains everything:
